# Cleaning Climate Change Data
Climate Temperature Change 1991 - 2016
I wanted to experiment with the climate change temperature public data and clean it in order to get the most of it. The data is found in the following link:

https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/download-data

It shows climate change data with the variable = temperature for all the countries between 1991 - 2016. In this notebook I will provide functions to clean the data so data scientists can visualize it and take the most of it.

## The steps I followed:
1. Dispalying the data
2. Cleaning the names of the columns using basic NLP functions
3. Spliting the data into data frames by year or by country
4. Visualizing examples of those data frames using Seaborn

This example shows how to split data by_country or by_name and to compare visually them using histograms.
